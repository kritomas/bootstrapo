			Hello lads and welcome to my blog. Today, we will talk about the superiority of Linux.

					A long time ago, there was UNIX. And everyone forked it, giving rise to many distributions, each better than UNIX at some things, worse at other. The creator of UNIX, Bell Labs had to agree, due to anti-monopoly policies. One day, the policy expired, and Bell Labs sued everyone for daring to improve their system. Marking the beginning of The UNIX Wars.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many distributions fell in the war, forgotten by history. FreeBSD was the only one to survive. Not even UNIX lived long enough to tell the tale. It was a time of great sorrow, as the greatest system of the world almost died. But little did anyone know, a new system would emerge from the darkness, one, that would surpass them all.
				</p>
				<p>
					There was a man, Richard Stallman, and he had an idea. "Why should 'free' stand for 'free of charge'? why not 'freedom'?" He thought. Angered by the unnecessary bloodshed of The UNIX Wars, he set off to create a new system. One that had all the good of UNIX, and also without the bad of Bell Labs. He started simple, with GCC, a free, as in freedom, C Compiler. With this new and powerful tool, he would create all the necessary components of an operating system. This system would be POSIX-compliant. He formed The 3 Comandments:
				</p>
				<ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
					<li class="list-group-item">The source code of all software shall be freely available, to anyone obtaining a copy of the software.</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">Anyone shall be allowed to use the software and its source code for any purpose, including to copy, modify, publish, distribute, or sell.</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">Any derivatives shall be distributed under the same, or similar, rights.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					And he started a movement. It had a name. GNU's Not UNIX.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the meantime, another man, Linus Torvalds, would set off to create an operating system Kernel. Why? Because he wanted to, and he wanted to learn. He would create the git Version Control System, because other VCSs weren't good enough. And he would write the Kernel all by himself. It had a name. Linux.
				</p>
				<p>
					Stallmam's system was coming along nicely. He had everything, a bootloader, text editor, C compiler, C standard library, everything, for free, as in freedom. Everything, except for one. He was struggling with the kernel. Luckily, an existing Kernel had the same idea of free. And it, too, happened to be POSIX-compliant.
				</p>
				<p>
					And with that, this new operating system was now complete. It has a name. GNU/Linux.
				</p>
				<p>
					Distributions would arise, Debian, Arch, and many others. It truly was a system to surpass them all, untouched by the evil skrill of the Microsoft/Apple/Google coalition. They coexist in harmony, to this day.
